# metassm
metassm is a bioinformatics project for benchmarking genome assembly tools. This Snakemake pipeline processes whole-genome data (ONT, Illumina, or hybrid) with steps for quality control, assembly, and evaluation. It provides a reproducible framework to identify the best methods for genome assembly and annotation.
